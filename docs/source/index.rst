Welcome to graphicle's documentation!
====================================

``graphicle`` is a package to represent and manipulate particle physics
data, with first class support for network-based analysis. Tutorials are
on the way, but for now, the API reference contains documentation of the
provided routines and their use cases. A small demo of the features are
included on this page, too.
